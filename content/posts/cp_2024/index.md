## General information

The aim of the course is to acquaint students with the basic concepts and techniques of software development in one of the established general programming languages. The student also gains a reliable view of future developments in the field of creating and using programs. After completing the exercises and the exam, the student acquires the following competencies:

- knows how to create his own computer program with which he can solve less demanding engineering problems,
- is able to work with professional software developers, and
- is able to upgrade existing knowledge to solve more challenging problems.
