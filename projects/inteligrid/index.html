				<p>InteliGrid addresses the lack of integrated computing environment that would providing the engineering industries with challenging integration and interoperability needs with a flexible, secure, robust, ambient accessible, interoperable, pay-per-demand access to (1) information, (2) communication and (3) processing infrastructure.</p>
				<p>InteliGrid project addressed these challenge by successfully combined and extended state-of-the-art research and technologies in three key areas: (a) semantic interoperability, (b) virtual organisations, and (c) grid technology to provide standards-based collection of ontology based services and grid middleware in support of dynamic virtual organisations as well as grid enabled engineering applications.</p>
