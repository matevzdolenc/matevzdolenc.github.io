				<p>Basic research project, supported by Slovenian Research Agency, is aimed in development innovative computing environment, which will enable a seismic risk assessment of urban areas, or determination of the seismic risk assessment of a particular building in the design or strengthening process. The computing environment will reuse state-of-the-art secure grid technology to interconnect with other similar environments.</p>
				<p>The results of the project are applications, which can be used to facilitate and accelerate the adoption of more realistic and transparent procedures for estimation of seismic risk and design of structures. Such applications can substantially contribute to reduce the risk of human or economic losses due to earthquake.</p>
				<p>The research is performed in close cooperation with the research group Earthquake Engineering and e-Construction, both at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The proposed research represents a continuation of some EU funded projects at which the researchers of the research group Earthquake Engineering or e-Construction participated.</p>
